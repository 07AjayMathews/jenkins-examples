# jenkins-examples
This is a repository of simple Jenkins examples.

Most examples at present use the Jenkins pipeline feature introduced around Jenkins 1.6, so keep the following docs handy:

1. [basic doc](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/)
2. [command reference](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/)

## Prerequisites ##

You should have a Jenkins instance to try this out on. The easiest way is to [download it for your operating system](https://jenkins.io/download/) but you can also [run a Jenkins Docker container.](https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/).

## Using the examples

Each folder contains a `Jenkinsfile` which demonstrates a basic concept. To try out each example, read the `README` file located in each folder.
